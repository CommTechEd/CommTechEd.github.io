    <h2>EasyEDA Basics</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="https://easyeda.com/" target="_blank">EasyEDA Pro</a> works better in Chrome (some features didn't work in Firefox). The standard/educational edition may not be supported much longer.
        <br />An EDA program stands for Electronic Design Automation and allows you to create custom printed circuit boards.
        <br />EasyEDA allows you to order the boards directly from the online editor. Another popular free EDA tool is <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" target="_blank">KiCad</a> but that must be installed locally.
        <br />Popular professional paid tools are Eagle and Altium. However, here you're paying for professional customer support and advanced features you most likely won't need for your boards.

        There are two main files that you need to create in order to make a custom PCB - a schematic file and board layout file. EDA software has tools or different programs to create each type of file.
        <br />The schematic file contains just the digital schematic of all the components you want on your board. Connections between components are done with lines called "wires". These wires aren't just virtual, they aren't actual wires yet.
        <br />When you make connections with wires, you create what is called a net. A way to think of a net is like your voltage rails. For example, all of your power pins that connect to Vcc using wires are all in the Vcc net.
