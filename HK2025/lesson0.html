    <h2>The Engineering Mindset, The Design Process, and Documentation.</h2>
    <p>
        The engineering mindset is a way to frame your observations and consider your actions. For instance, some may
        say a glass is half empty, others the glass is half full, an engineer may say the glass wasn’t built to
        specifications! When applying the engineering mindset, most everything can be defined as a problem with many
        potential solutions and non-solutions.
        <br /><br />The design process is a disciplined approach to solving problems within well defined contexts. It is
        both iterative (which means the steps of the process may be repeated or be skipped depending on the context of
        the problem and the status of the solution) and reflective (which means one should evaluate their work and
        improve upon both their process through reflection).
        <br /><br />The mindset acknowledges compromises to every solution; one must balance between “good enough is the
        enemy of great” and “perfect is the enemy of good”. Data are the most common tool used to make design choices
        and evaluate the process and solutions. This is similar to how athletes train for a sport. If a sports game were
        the ultimate problem being solved, then the rules, current playing field conditions, the condition of the
        athlete(s), and allowed equipment define the problem well within that specific context. When training, a coach
        (like an engineer) uses data taken from activities like weight lifting (like an experiment) and previous game
        performances (like reflecting) to consider their approach and direct the athletes (iterating for each game).
        Even though there are many great coaches that may be better than other coaches, every team must have their own
        coach.
        <br /><br />Documentation is a requirement for the design process giving consideration for the limits of human
        memory and communication. As you apply the engineering mindset, work through the design process, and communicate
        your results, there will be a lot of information to remember and discuss with others. Documentation is NOT a
        formal presentation written after a design is deemed completed. Documentation is more a collection of clues you
        record during the design process answering the what and how you achieved a solution which then can be organized
        into something like a story of your design. Text and pictures are the default mediums but engineers now commonly
        use video or audio when appropriate. Ideally, documentation should be thorough and organized enough so one may
        use it to retrace your steps and accomplish the same results for every design.
        <br /><br />Applying the engineering mindset as a teacher, I document my work through a collection of files
        detailing my lessons in an online account along with archives of student work. I use this collection to reflect
        and iterate each year to improve upon the lessons. I’ve learned the hard way that improper documentation may
        lead to frustration when you forget past accomplishments or procedures. While designing, it is difficult to
        recognize the impact of not properly recording and organizing your documentation as it may take years to be
        known. Documentation also serves to validate your efforts and gain recognition in the field; without a record of
        your efforts, others are less likely to give you credit, compensate you, and trust in your skills! The small
        effort required to take some notes, a picture, or video recording and store it with today's tools while you're
        working is very much worth it.

    <h3>Toolchain Setup challenge</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DY_VL_dKfKzQGMo9SsHTucLM7bzkNkAotUzuyj70eBQ/edit?usp=sharing"
            target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a journal entry I made when learning how to setup VSCode for the
        new boards we'll be using.
        <br />Once you fill out the welcome form and have your digital journals shared with you, please begin your own
        entries on setting up your toolchain.
        <br />At the end of this challenge, you should be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new Arduino project using PlatformIO in VSCode for an Arduino UNO</li>
        <li>Describe in your journal what you think a toolchain is</li>
        <li>Advanced (for now*): create a new project for RP2040 in VSCode (*this will take some time but will need to
            be done before Wednesday)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Optional challenge (to complete outside of class): Reflecting on this lesson</h3>
    <p>
        Reflecting back on your work is a good way to hone your engineering design skills. Here are some prompts to help
        you reflect on this lesson while outside of class:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Write your own understanding of the engineering mindset, the design process, and documentation. Attempt to
            write your own analogy for at least one of the terms (especially the one you may be least comfortable with).
        </li>
        <li>Identify at least one statement made above and write a brief (e.g. one paragraph) reflection of it. During
            the reflection, test the statement with your own experiences and determine how well it holds up.</li>
        <li>Find at least one collaborating or conflicting source to the concepts described above. Evaluate this</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advanced challenge</h3>
    <p>
        Create your own Github account and start a repository for this course after installing Git on your PC.
        <br />There are many guides online on how to get started and Git can be very complexing. For our context,
        getting started can be simply done in the terminal.
        <br />Once you create a new project folder and open it in VSCode, Git will allow you to store and share your
        projects in the cloud and keep track of your changes.
        <br />Github pages is also a good way to create a professional personal portfolio to showcase your work.
        <br />To get started after creating your first repo in your browser, open up the folder in VSCode you'd like to
        stoare it in and use the terminal to do the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repo: <code>git clone [yourRepoURL]</code> </li>
        <li>Configure git to your account's email: <code>git config --global user.email "[yourEmail]"</code></li>
        <li>Change directory to the new repo clone: <code>cd [yourRepoFolderName]</code></li>
        <li>Make a simple change, save it (or turn on auto save in file menu), and then add all changes:
            <code>git add --all</code>
        </li>
        <li>Commit the changes to your local repo with required description of changes in quotes:
            <code>git commit -m "made changes"</code>
        </li>
        <li>Push your commits to the main branch of your cloud repo: <code>git push -u origin main</code></li>
        <li>Use the up arrow key to repeat the last three steps (add,commit, push) anytime you'd like to save a change
            to the remote repo</li>
    </ol>
