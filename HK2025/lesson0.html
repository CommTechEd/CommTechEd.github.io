    <h2>The Engineering Mindset, The Design Process, and Documentation.</h2>
    <p>
        The engineering mindset is a way to frame your observations and consider your actions. For instance, some may say a glass is half empty, others the glass is half full, an engineer may say the glass wasn’t built to specifications! When applying the engineering mindset, most everything can be defined as a problem with many potential solutions and non-solutions.
        <br /><br />The design process is a disciplined approach to solving problems within well defined contexts. It is both iterative (which means the steps of the process may be repeated or be skipped depending on the context of the problem and the status of the solution) and reflective (which means one should evaluate their work and improve upon both their process through reflection).
        <br /><br />The mindset acknowledges compromises to every solution; one must balance between “good enough is the enemy of great” and “perfect is the enemy of good”. Data are the most common tool used to make design choices and evaluate the process and solutions. This is similar to how athletes train for a sport. If a sports game were the ultimate problem being solved, then the rules, current playing field conditions, the condition of the athlete(s), and allowed equipment define the problem well within that specific context. When training, a coach (like an engineer) uses data taken from activities like weight lifting (like an experiment) and previous game performances (like reflecting) to consider their approach and direct the athletes (iterating for each game). Even though there are many great coaches that may be better than other coaches, every team must have their own coach.
        <br /><br />Documentation is a requirement for the design process giving consideration for the limits of human memory and communication. As you apply the engineering mindset, work through the design process, and communicate your results, there will be a lot of information to remember and discuss with others. Documentation is NOT a formal presentation written after a design is deemed completed. Documentation is more a collection of clues you record during the design process answering the what and how you achieved a solution which then can be organized into something like a story of your design. Text and pictures are the default mediums but engineers now commonly use video or audio when appropriate. Ideally, documentation should be thorough and organized enough so one may use it to retrace your steps and accomplish the same results for every design.
        <br /><br />Applying the engineering mindset as a teacher, I document my work through a collection of files detailing my lessons in an online account along with archives of student work. I use this collection to reflect and iterate each year to improve upon the lessons. I’ve learned the hard way that improper documentation may lead to frustration when you forget past accomplishments or procedures. While designing, it is difficult to recognize the impact of not properly recording and organizing your documentation as it may take years to be known. Documentation also serves to validate your efforts and gain recognition in the field; without a record of your efforts, others are less likely to give you credit, compensate you, and trust in your skills! The small effort required to take some notes, a picture, or video recording and store it with today's tools while you're working is very much worth it.
