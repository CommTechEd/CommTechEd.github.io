    <h2>Using the HuskyLens w/ robot state machine</h2>

    <p>
        Here are the resources you need to get started on this lesson: <a
            href="https://github.com/HuskyLens/HUSKYLENSArduino" target="_blank">HuskyLens API</a> | <a
            href="https://wiki.dfrobot.com/HUSKYLENS_V1.0_SKU_SEN0305_SEN0336" target="_blank">HuskyLens Wiki</a>
        Also here is the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/classrooms/hS8iOnPLhGE/activities/4gPh1qyiTOL"
            target="_blank"> Tinkercad activity</a> on what a state machine can look like for your robot and why you
        need one.
    </p>
    <p>
        A state machine is just a fancy way to say that you want your robot to be in a stable behavior based upon its
        inputs and what behavior it is currently in.
        <br />If you just relied on the inputs to change your robot's behavior without remembering its current state,
        then you would be constantly calling functions without need.
        <br />A typical state machine is just a series of if / else if / else statements. To make it simple, each
        condition should be mutually exclusive (i.e. unique).
        <br />The default condition (else) is optional. This could be a failsafe to throw an error that your inputs went
        out of range.

    <h2>Spin and get ball challenge</h2>
    <p>
        Your husklens will be able to give you information on whether or not it sees the ball after you train it.
        <br />Constantly read in data from the husklens in your loop function and setup a simple state machine so that your robot's complex behavior is to spin until it sees the ball and then go forward when it sees the ball.
