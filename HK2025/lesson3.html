    <h2>Sensing the world!</h2>

    <p>
        Take a look at the <a href="../assets/seeeduinoNano.pdf" target="_blank">SeeduinoNano schematic</a>. Why is there a diode between Vcc and Vusb? 
        This illustrates the importance of understanding all of your different power sources and how they're connected!

    <p>
        Tinkercad warmup activity <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/classrooms/hS8iOnPLhGE/activities/aYCRd7uW8rT" target="_blank">here.</a>
        The tinkercad activity is an example of a basic way of sensing the white line. Using external circuits like a voltage comparator though, it will be make it much quicker for our robots.
        Take a look at the <a href="assets/groveLineFinder.pdf" target="_blank">grove line finder schematic</a>

    <h2>Stop at the line challenge</h2>
    <p>
        Use the grove line sensor to get your robot to stop at the line. You may need to shield from ambient light!
        Advanced: get your grove sensor to trigger an interrupt. It may be easier to do this by not using the grove plug on the nano.
