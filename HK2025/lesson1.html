    <h2>Coming to Terms - Basics of Electronics</h2>
    <p>
        When learning about electronics, it is like learning another language; keywords will have different meanings
        depending on what it is you're doing and what your experience level is. When learning this “language” the goals
        are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaining personal models of understanding of the terms throughout your experience to help in being more
            confident and discovering new or better methods.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to how you and others use these terms to help conventions develop that will help collaborate
            with others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Learning these terms is NOT like memorizing definitions of terms for a standardized test. The correct definition
        is the one that will help you understand your designs and communicate to others at the time; be prepared for
        these definitions to change!
    </p>

    <p>
        The first step in learning these terms is to simply be able to identify them as key terms. Then study how others
        are using them and see how they apply in your own experiences. Eventually these terms will be linked to memories
        and thoughts that will be a working model of that term. These mental models are what you will need to design!
        <br />Please keep reminding yourself that learning these terms will take practice. This is just an introduction.

    <h2>Basic circuit analysis</h2>
    <p>
        As an engineer, having an intuition on how circuits behave and only relying on formal math when necessary will
        allow you to design and troubleshoot more efficiently.
        For most of our circuits, we can start thinking of electricity as simply the flow of electrons from high to low.
        <br />High to low refers to voltage is just like air pressure when you're breathing. When you breath in air, you
        expand your lungs to create a low pressure causing the air to move in from the higher pressure atmosphere.
        <br />Voltage is always a difference between two electrical potentials just like air pressure is always the
        difference between two volumes of air.
        <br />Current is the amount of electrons flowing past a point per second (not their speed).
        <br />Resistance is how much the electrons are being prevented from moving.
        <br />When you breath in through your nose, you may move air just as fast but at less volume than when breathing
        through your mouth because your nose has more resistance.
        <br />We care about the current because we don't want to overload and damage our circuits (i.e. release the
        magic smoke!).
        <br />We care about voltage and how it drops across components because that is how information is encoded in our
        systems.
        <br />There are direct relationships between current (I), voltage (V), resistance (R), and power (R) however
        some devices break this law; they're called nonohmic. Not all nonohmic devices behave the same but diodes like
        LEDs can be considered to have a fixed voltage drop called a forward voltage and very little resistance when
        conducting; hence why all LEDs need some sort of current control and can't be powered directly unless the
        voltage is just above their foward voltage.
        <br />The circuit simulations below will allow you to experiment and build intuitions on how to analyze basic
        circuits.

    <h2>Basic Circuit Components & Schematics</h2>
    <p>Every component has a schematic symbol that is used to make a schematic
        <br />A schematic is just a map of the connections NOT a map marking the physical locations or orientations of
        the components
        <br />The clearer one can see the connections being made, the better the schematic. Often, components like ICs
        have pins drawn in different locations to make it easier to see the connections
        <br />One way to think about it is that each terminal of a component is like a dot and wires (or PCB traces) are
        the lines that connnect the dots
        <br />If a schematic symbol is not symmetrical, then it is probably polar and you should pay attention to how
        you are connecting it!
        <br />SparkFun has a great article about reading schematics <a
            href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic/all" target="_blank">here.</a>
        <br />We use solderless breadboards to make quick and temporary connections with our components. Again, SparkFun
        has a great article about using breadboards

    <h2>Basic Embedded Systems Programming w/ Arduino</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/">The Arduino reference</a> will give you a lot of the
        information to help get started with programming using its core.
        <br />However, the Arduino core wasn't designed for engineers so common examples may not follow engineering
        conventions like fixed width integer data types or static variables.
        <br />In general, the less you rely on high level tools, the more efficient and effective your designs can be
        but you must balance it with the time and effort it will take to go low level.
        <br />A good low level goal is to understand port manipulation and bitwise operators described in <a
            href="https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/hacking/software/PortManipulation/" target="_blank">this article.</a>
        <br />These techniques will come in handy to make your robot's program run much faster and allow you to unlock
        new potential out of components!

    <h2>Light to digital blinky challenge</h2>
    <p>
        Use the lessons here to start with building a simple circuit that will properly light an LED on a breadboard -
        please have me check your schematic and circuit before powering it on!
        <br />Then use the components from your 555 soldering kit to blink the LED on your breadboard - again, please
        have me check your schematic and circuit before powering it on
        <br />Finally, use the toolchain you setup in lesson0 and the styling described in the Tinkercad lesson to blink
        an LED using your microcontroller.
    </p>

    <h2>Advanced challenge: faster digital blinky</h2>
    <p>
        Use port manipulation and bitwise operators to blink an LED using only two lines of code in your loop or blink
        function definition.
    </p>

    <h2>Special Challenges</h2>
    <p>These challenges can be done on your own or if you have extra time in class. They are meant to check for
        understanding not to trick you</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have four LEDs and a power source that is regulated at 5V and can handle up to 40mA. Draw a schematic
            that will light all four LEDs at their max current of 20mA each.</li>
        <li>How many LEDs can you independantly control with 3 GPIO pins? (hint: it is more than 3)</li>
    </ol>
