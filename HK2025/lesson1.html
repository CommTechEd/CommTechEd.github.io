    <h2>Coming to Terms - Basics of Electronics</h2>
    <p>
        When learning about electronics, it is like learning another language; keywords will have different meanings depending on what it is you’re doing and what your experience level is. When learning this “language” the goals are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaining personal models of understanding of the terms throughout your experience to help in being more confident and discovering new or better methods.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to how you and others use these terms to help conventions develop that will help collaborate with others.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Learning these terms is NOT like memorizing definitions of terms for a standardized test. The correct definition is the one that will help you understand your designs and communicate to others at the time; be prepared for these definitions to change!
    </p>

    <p>
        The first step in learning these terms is to simply be able to identify them as key terms. Then study how others are using them and see how they apply in your own experiences. Eventually these terms will be linked to memories and thoughts that will be a working model of that term. These mental models are what you will need to design!
    </p>
