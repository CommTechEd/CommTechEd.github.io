    <h2>Coming to Terms - Basics of Electronics</h2>
    <p>
        When learning about electronics, it is like learning another language; keywords will have different meanings
        depending on what it is you’re doing and what your experience level is. When learning this “language” the goals
        are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaining personal models of understanding of the terms throughout your experience to help in being more
            confident and discovering new or better methods.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to how you and others use these terms to help conventions develop that will help collaborate
            with others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Learning these terms is NOT like memorizing definitions of terms for a standardized test. The correct definition
        is the one that will help you understand your designs and communicate to others at the time; be prepared for
        these definitions to change!
    </p>

    <p>
        The first step in learning these terms is to simply be able to identify them as key terms. Then study how others
        are using them and see how they apply in your own experiences. Eventually these terms will be linked to memories
        and thoughts that will be a working model of that term. These mental models are what you will need to design!
        <br />Please keep reminding yourself that learning these terms will take practice. This is just an introduction.

    <h2>Basic circuit analysis</h2>
    <p>
        As an engineer, having an intuition on how circuits behave and only relying on formal math when necessary will
        allow you to design and troubleshoot more efficiently.
        For most of our circuits, we can start thinking of electricity as simply the flow of electrons from high to low.
        <br />High to low refers to voltage is just like air pressure when you're breathing. When you breath in air, you
        expand your lungs to create a low pressure causing the air to move in from the higher pressure atmosphere.
        <br />Voltage is always a difference between two electrical potentials just like air pressure is always the
        difference between two volumes of air.
        <br />Current is the amount of electrons flowing past a point per second (not their speed).
        <br />Resistance is how much the electrons are being prevented from moving.
        <br />When you breath in through your nose, you may move air just as fast but at less volume than when breathing
        through your mouth because your nose has more resistance.
        <br />We care about the current because we don't want to overload and damage our circuits (i.e. release the
        magic smoke!).
        <br />We care about voltage and how it drops because that is how information is encoded in our systems.
        <br />The circuit simulations below will allow you to experiment and build intuitions on how to analyze basic
        circuits.
