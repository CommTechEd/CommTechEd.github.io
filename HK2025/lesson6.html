    <h2>I2C and the APDS9960</h2>
    <p>
        The APDS9960 is a very powerful yet economical sensor that will allow you to detect if you've captured the ball.
        It does this in part b/c it will pulse the IR and also allow for automatic ambient light subtraction making this sensor more robust than the simple line follower.
        <br />In order to talk I2C you must know a few basic items about the protocol. There is a leader (typically the microcontroller) that may have multiple followers (e.g. sensors).
        <br />Since all components share the same two communication lines (Serial Data/SDA and Serial Clock/SCL) every device must have an address.
        <br />I2C addresses are typically one byte and contain a bit that determines if you are going to be writing data or reading data (the R/W bit).
        The Arduino Wire libary will only use 7-bit addresses and append the appropriate R/W bit depending on what method you're using.
        <br />Many datasheets may give the 8-bit write address so to find the 7-bt address, quickly run the <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner/" target="_blank">I2C scanner program</a>.
        <br />After scanning, the first thing you want to do is try to communicate to the device and get its unique ID in the ID register.
        To do this, simply write the address of the ID register to let the device know where you're reading from. Then request 1 byte back and print out the result. It should match what is in the datasheet if the ID register is availble.
        <br />Notice to read from a device, you must write what register address you'd like to read from first and then make the request.
        <br />To write to a device, simply begin trasmission, write the address of the byte you'd like to write, and then write the data you'd like at that regiser address.
        Many devices will allow you to read or write consecutive bytes - the register address will automatically increment.
    </p>
    <p>
        By studying the datasheet of your I2C devices, it'll give you great insight of how it works - moreso than any library or API can. It also gives you full control over the device.
        For example, you can use tune proximity sensor to accurately detect the ball at a distance by adjusting the pulse width (long pulses == longer range == more power), pulse integration time (more time == greater sensitivity), and LED intensity (greater == more range == more power).
        <br />You can also set interrupts for a saturation error (e.g. ambient conditions become too bright) or a persitance filter on upper and lower thresholds (must read within threshold a set number of times).

    <h2>Ball detection w/ custom functions challenge</h2>
    <p>
        Use I2C Scanner to scan for sensor after attatchign it to the grove sensor port and 7-bit address.
        <br />Succesfully get the ID byte to print to the serial monitor using a apdsBegin() function you write and call in setup.
        <br />Use an APDS9960 library to test out getting the proximity reading from the example.
        <br />Use write own functions to configure the proximity sensor for the best results.
        <br />Advanced: set up an interrupt and use it for ball detection on an IO pin (note, you can just configure the sensor's hardware interrupt and poll it on the microcontroller).
