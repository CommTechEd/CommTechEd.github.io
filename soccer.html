    <h2>RoboCupJunior Soccer</h2>

    <p>
        This is the main page for the <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/">international rules</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike other competitions (like Vex), RCJ is designed so that:
    <ul>
        <li>The focus is on engineering education and students' unique accomplishments rather than competition rankings
        </li>
        <li>The game will have limited changes to it's rules each season - you iterate designs over seasons</li>
        <li>Every team member must have a technical role - limit to 4 (maybe 5 next season) members</li>
        <li>Final rankings calculated by on field performance, judged assessments, and special challenges - just winning
            matches isn't enough</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/eKAnwP-I-Uw?si=F2gax1V_6QSLNyJX" target="_blank">2024 open finals match</a> there are some fancy moves but the two main objectives for your robot is to:
        <ol>
            <li>Keep your robot inbounds</li>
            <li>Be able to score on an open goal</li>
        </ol>
        <br />Notice how the winning team may have lost because they couldn't keep their one robot in bounds!
        <br />Notice how the losing team may have won if they were able to score better on open field!
        <br />These two objectives should be your main focus for your robot design at all times.
