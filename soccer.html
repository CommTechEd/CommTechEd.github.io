        This is the main page for the <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/">international rules</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike other competitions (like Vex), RCJ is designed so that:
    <ul>
        <li>The focus is on engineering education and students' unique accomplishments rather than competition rankings
        </li>
        <li>The game will have limited changes to it's rules each season - you iterate designs over seasons</li>
        <li>Every team member must have a technical role - limit to 4 (maybe 5 next season) members</li>
        <li>Final rankings calculated by on field performance, judged assessments, and special challenges - just winning
            matches isn't enough</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
