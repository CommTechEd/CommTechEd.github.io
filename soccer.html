    <h2>RoboCupJunior Soccer</h2>

    <p>
        Every engineering design has a well defined problem with criteria (i.e. goals) and constraints (i.e. limits).
        <br />The problem and constraints are defined in the league's rules.
        <br />The criteria are speified in the awards rubric
        <br />The constraints must be met. You must decide on the criteria!
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the main page for the <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/">international rules</a>
        <br />Regions and superRegions may modify these rules or offer special programs like entry challenges.
        <br />Be sure to RTFM (read the friendly manual) and understand the rules while preparing for that event!
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike other competitions (like Vex), RCJ is designed so that:
    <ul>
        <li>The focus is on engineering education and students' unique accomplishments rather than competition rankings
        </li>
        <li>The game will have limited changes to it's rules each season - you iterate designs over seasons</li>
        <li>Every team member must have a technical role - limit to 4 (maybe 5 next season) members</li>
        <li>Final rankings calculated by on field performance, judged assessments, and special challenges - just winning
            matches isn't enough</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/eKAnwP-I-Uw?si=dKuHqMX_xFcZ6PJl&t=5838" target="_blank">2024 open finals match</a> there are some fancy moves but the two main criteria for your robots are:
        <ol>
            <li>Your robots stay inbounds</li>
            <li>Be able to score on an open goal</li>
        </ol>
        <br />Notice how the winning team may have lost because they couldn't keep their one robot in bounds!
        <br />Notice how the losing team may have won if they were able to score better on open field (and didn't score on themselves)!
        <br />These two objectives should be your main focus for your robot design at all times.
        <br />As you gain more experience, you'll recognize how difficult seemingly simple criteria can be to achieve!

    <p>
        This match has almost all the situations that can occur happen (pushing, out of bounds, double defense, defender only)
        <br />Add to your journal some other observations you make about the match. From the setup to the final whistle, what could be done better? What was impressive? What may you be confused about?
