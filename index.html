        Welcome! This is a simple page that will be used to link all of the challenges and resources used in the course
    </p>

    <p>
        The main goal is prepare you for participating in the RoboCupJunior (RCJ) Soccer Open League.
        <a href="soccer.html">Here are some details of the challenge.</a>
        <br />We'll achieve that goal by completing a series of challenges
    </p>

    <p>
        How you approach a challenge is more relevant than solving it. These challenges have common solutions but only
        because people
        already applied the engineering design process to discover these solutions. We use
        challenges with common solutions to practice and hone our approach so that we may find solutions to challenges
        that are yet to be discovered. If you fail, you've simply found an approach that doesn't work which may make you
        better. Make a goal to learn what to focus on, what to test, and what you can ignore. For you to truly design,
        there cannot be any instructions! These challenges are deceptive in that they seem simple but do not get
        discouraged - simple tasks we do everyday like walking, riding a bike, playing a sport, or playing a music
        instrument all took many hours of practice - the same goes for learning how to engineer!
