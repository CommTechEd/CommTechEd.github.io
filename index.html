    <h2>HK Summer 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! This is a simple page that will be used to link all of the challenges and resources used in the course. This page will get updated daily with the course goals and new lessons.
    </p>

    <h2>Today's Goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get your journals loaded up and be sure to upload pictures and take notes of all of our work (maybe try journaling on your phones?).</li>
        <li>You may begin working upon arrival - skim through Mighty Ohm's soldering guide linked in new resource section & prepare for soldering by taping IC soccets to 555/4017 practice board (should have demo on table)</li>
        <li>Once you practice soldering after a demo to start, will need to solder motor cables to make them compatible with breadboard</li>
        <li>Get your robots moving with Lesson 2! - may need to use hot glue to tac into place components and foam core to raise breadboards above wheels (please only dots/dabs of glue - don't use too much!)</li>
        <li>If time, get your robots sensing with lesson 3. There is a new associated Tinkercad activity in that lesson you may work on as well.</li>
        <li>Be ready for journal review tonight so please add content from yesterday; we'll review as often as you need (yes - we covered A LOT!)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Lesson Links</h2>
    There is a lot of information especially in the first two lessons - please take your time and try to fight feeling overwhelmed. These will remain up so you can review them at anytime (and you probably will need to review them!).

    <h1>-------Previous Daily Plans Archived Below------</h1>
    <h2>Monday's Goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Introduce you to the soccer comp via resource page here and YouTube of finals match</li>
        <li>Introduce you to basics of electronics & embedded systems through lesson1, Tinkercad Blinky template, and
            Falstad simulations (now updated)</li>
        <li>Prepare your toolchain and program Seeeduino Nano (lesson0) with Blinky template</li>
        <li>Prepare robot chassis for build tomorrow</li>
        <li>Setup everyone's journal via Google into form</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The main goal is prepare you for participating in the RoboCupJunior (RCJ) Soccer Open League.
        <a href="soccer.html">Here are some details of the challenge.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll achieve that goal by completing a series of challenges that allow you to practice applying the
        engineering mindset. How you approach a challenge is more relevant than solving it.
        These challenges have common solutions but only because people already applied the engineering design process to
        discover these solutions. We use
        challenges with common solutions to practice and hone our approach so that we may find solutions to challenges
        that are yet to be discovered. If you fail, you've simply found an approach that doesn't work which may make you
        better. Make a goal to learn what to focus on, what to test, and what you can ignore. For you to truly design,
        there cannot be any instructions! These challenges are deceptive in that they seem simple but do not get
        discouraged - simple tasks we do everyday like walking, riding a bike, playing a sport, or playing a music
        instrument all took many hours of practice - the same goes for learning how to engineer!

            target="_blank">intro form</a> before proceeding to the lessons so your digital journals may be shared with
        you using your prefered Google account</p>
    <h2>Challenge Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please take notes of your understandings and developments as you work. You may use the notepads to sketch
            schematics and take pictures, take handwritten notes, take all digitla notes, or any method of recording
            documentation that works for you as long as it can be included or linked to the journal shared with you.
        </li>
        <li>Please sketch a schematic for all of your circuits and have your circuits checked before powering them on.
        </li>
        <li>Please do not use AI searches to find solutions; please try to rely on the sources linked in the lessons
        </li>
        <li>These lessons are designed to have you get stuck and make errors; although the information may be
            intentionally incomplete it should not be misleading. Please ask all the questions you have!</li>
    </ul>
