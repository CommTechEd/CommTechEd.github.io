        Hello World!!
        <h2>HK Summer 2025</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome! This is a simple page that will be used to link all of the challenges and resources used in the course
        </p>
        <p>
            The main goal is prepare you for participating in the RoboCupJunior (RCJ) Soccer Open League. <a href="/soccer.html">Here are some details of the challenge.</a>
            Unlike other competitions (like Vex), RCJ is designed so that:
            <ul>
                <li>The focus is on engineering education and students' unique accomplishments rather than competition rankings</li>
                <li>The game will have limited changes to it's rules</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            How you approach a problem is more relevant than solving it. These challenges have common solutions but only due to the people who applied the engineering design process to discover these solutions in the first place. We use challenges with common solutions to practice and hone our approach so that we may find solutions to challenges that are yet to be discovered. If you fail, you’ve simply found an approach that doesn’t work which may make you better. Make a goal to learn what to focus on, what to test, and what you can ignore. For you to truly design, there cannot be any instructions! These challenges are deceptive in that they seem simple but do not get discouraged - simple tasks we do everyday like walking, riding a bike, playing a sport, or playing a music instrument all took many hours of practice - the same goes for learning how to engineer!
