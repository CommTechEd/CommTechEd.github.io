    <h2>HK Summer 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! This is a simple page that will be used to link all of the challenges and resources used in the course.
        This page will get updated daily with the course goals and new lessons.
    </p>

    <h2>Today's Goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Complete soldering and building your robot</li>
        <li>Use the code templates to finish and test unit tests for motorStateTest, lineIntTest, haveBallTest, cameraStateTest</li>
        <li>Write a unit test for the Pico to communicate "seeGoalFlag" to the Nano - just use the lights! (this unit test has two programs!)</li>
        <li>Write a final program that puts all the unit tests together and plays the game - note when to clear the flags!</li>
        <li>(if time) Finalize schematic and being laying out PCB - "never trust the autorouter" ~ Dave Jones</li>

        <li>WARNING: the KB2040 uses 3v3 for Vcc so you'll need a new rail on your solderable breadboard if not using qt
            cables.</li>
        <li>It is OK to use 3v3 to talk to 5v. It is not OK to use 5V to talk to 3v3!</li>

            <br /> -offensive program that will find the ball and try to push it past your opponent.
            <br /> -any robot that crosses the taped lines will earn a point for the opposing robot and kick will reset
            <br /> -may add foam core or other structural components to help - robot should fit in 18cm cube (about the

    </ol>

    <h2>Monday's Goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Introduce you to the soccer comp via resource page here and YouTube of finals match</li>
        <li>Introduce you to basics of electronics & embedded systems through lesson1, Tinkercad Blinky template, and

    </ol>
    <p>
        The main goal is prepare you for participating in the RoboCupJunior (RCJ) Soccer Open League.
        <a href="soccer.html">Here are some details of the challenge.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll achieve that goal by completing a series of challenges that allow you to practice applying the
        engineering mindset. How you approach a challenge is more relevant than solving it.
        These challenges have common solutions but only because people already applied the engineering design process to
        discover these solutions. We use
        challenges with common solutions to practice and hone our approach so that we may find solutions to challenges
        that are yet to be discovered. If you fail, you've simply found an approach that doesn't work which may make you
        better. Make a goal to learn what to focus on, what to test, and what you can ignore. For you to truly design,
        there cannot be any instructions! These challenges are deceptive in that they seem simple but do not get
        discouraged - simple tasks we do everyday like walking, riding a bike, playing a sport, or playing a music
        instrument all took many hours of practice - the same goes for learning how to engineer!

        Please fill out this <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTK1n5KL5KlmQq6IUqlfUGfxs4XCV8dRMhUTTT3lvFZDug7A/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=111216294004552312243"
            target="_blank">intro form</a> before proceeding to the lessons so your digital journals may be shared with
        you using your prefered Google account</p>
    <h2>Challenge Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please take notes of your understandings and developments as you work. You may use the notepads to sketch
            schematics and take pictures, take handwritten notes, take all digitla notes, or any method of recording
            documentation that works for you as long as it can be included or linked to the journal shared with you.
        </li>
        <li>Please sketch a schematic for all of your circuits and have your circuits checked before powering them on.
        </li>
        <li>Please do not use AI searches to find solutions; please try to rely on the sources linked in the lessons
        </li>
        <li>These lessons are designed to have you get stuck and make errors; although the information may be
            intentionally incomplete it should not be misleading. Please ask all the questions you have!</li>
    </ul>
