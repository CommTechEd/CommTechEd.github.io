    <h2>HK Summer 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! This is a simple page that will be used to link all of the challenges and resources used in the course
    </p>

    <p>
        The main goal is prepare you for participating in the RoboCupJunior (RCJ) Soccer Open League.
        <a href="soccer.html">Here are some details of the challenge.</a>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll achieve that goal by completing a series of challenges that allow you to practice applying the engineering mindset. How you approach a challenge is more relevant than solving it. 
        These challenges have common solutions but only because people already applied the engineering design process to discover these solutions. We use
        challenges with common solutions to practice and hone our approach so that we may find solutions to challenges
        that are yet to be discovered. If you fail, you've simply found an approach that doesn't work which may make you
        better. Make a goal to learn what to focus on, what to test, and what you can ignore. For you to truly design,
        there cannot be any instructions! These challenges are deceptive in that they seem simple but do not get
        discouraged - simple tasks we do everyday like walking, riding a bike, playing a sport, or playing a music
        instrument all took many hours of practice - the same goes for learning how to engineer!

        Please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTK1n5KL5KlmQq6IUqlfUGfxs4XCV8dRMhUTTT3lvFZDug7A/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=111216294004552312243" target="_blank">intro form</a> before proceeding to the lessons so your digital journals may be shared with you using your prefered Google account</p>
    <h2>Challenge Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please take notes of your understandings and developments as you work. You may use the notepads to sketch schematics and take pictures, take handwritten notes, take all digitla notes, or any method of recording documentation that works for you as long as it can be included or linked to the journal shared with you.</li>
        <li>Please sketch a schematic for all of your circuits and have your circuits checked before powering them on.</li>
        <li>Please do not use AI searches to find solutions; please try to rely on the sources linked in the lessons</li>
        <li>These lessons are designed to have you get stuck and make errors; although the information may be intentionally incomplete it should not be misleading. Please ask all the questions you have!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is a lot of information in the first two lessons - please take your time and try to fight feeling overwhelmed. Future lessons will be paced out based upon today.
